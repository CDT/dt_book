# Chords

[ðŸ‘‰Reference](https://muted.io/music-theory/#chapter-4)

Chords are the harmonious pillars of music.

They're groups of notes played together, giving depth to melodies and forming the backbone of countless songs.

From the emotive ballad to the upbeat pop tune, chords bring feelings and richness to tunes.

A chord is a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously. The simplest type of chord is the triad, which consists of three notes. These three notes are the root, the third, and the fifth (remember intervals ðŸ˜‰).

## Chord Types

### Triads

These are three-note chords and are the most fundamental. There are four primary types:

- **Major Triad:** Consists of a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. For instance, C-E-G.
 
- **Minor Triad:** Contains a root, a minor third, and a perfect fifth. For example, C-Eâ™­-G.
 
- **Diminished Triad:** Features a root, a minor third, and a diminished fifth. Like C-Eâ™­-Gâ™­.
 
- **Augmented Triad:** Has a root, a major third, and an augmented fifth. C-E-Gâ™¯ is an example.

### Sevenths

These are four-note chords. Adding a seventh note to a triad creates these:

- **Major 7th:** A major triad plus a major seventh.
 
- **Minor 7th:** A minor triad followed by a minor seventh.
 
- **Dominant 7th:** A major triad plus a minor seventh.
 
- **Half-Diminished:** A diminished triad with a minor seventh.

## Chord Inversions

When the notes of a chord are rearranged so that a note other than the root is the lowest note, we call this an inversion.

Inversions can provide smoother transitions between chords and give a different texture to the harmony.

For example:

- **Root Position:** The root is the lowest note. (C-E-G)
 
- **1st Inversion:** The third is the lowest note. (E-G-C)

- **2nd Inversion:** The fifth is the lowest note. (G-C-E)

## Chord Progressions

A sequence of chords played in order creates a chord progression.

These progressions lay the groundwork for many songs. A classic example is the I-IV-V progression, which in the key of C would be C-F-G.


## Using Chords

**Harmonization:** Chords provide the harmonious background against which melodies shine.

**Building Tension and Release:** Certain chords build tension (like the dominant seventh) that is resolved with the return to a more stable chord, often the tonic.

**Setting the Mood:** The type of chord (major, minor, diminished) can set the entire mood of a song or section.
