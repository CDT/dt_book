# Applications of Energy Solutions in Hospital/Healthcare

![Hospital](/images/hospital_demo.jpeg)

## 1. Market Overview:

- **Healthcare industry in Malaysia:** Growing steadily, driven by increasing population, government initiatives, and rising medical tourism. 

The Malaysia hospital market size was valued at **USD 8.06 billion in 2023**, driven by the rise in the geriatric population across Malaysia. The market size is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of **8.4%** during the forecast period of 2024-2032 to achieve a value of USD **16.35 billion by 2032**.

- **Demand for power solutions:** Critical for uninterrupted operations, especially in emergency departments, surgery rooms, and intensive care units. Server rooms of hospital information systems must also be uninterrupted.
- **Current reliance:** Primarily on grid power with backup diesel generators, offering limitations in efficiency, sustainability, and cost.

## 2. Market Needs and Opportunities:

### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

High demand for reliable and efficient UPS 
systems to protect sensitive medical equipment during power outages.

Hospitals have Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems installed to ensure a constant and reliable power supply to maintain life-saving daily operations 12. A power outage in a hospital is completely unacceptable; not only would it damage the institutionâ€™s reputation as unreliable, but it would also jeopardize the lives of patients and staff.

### Energy Storage Systems (ESS)

Potential for integrating with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to achieve energy independence, reduce reliance on diesel generators, and lower electricity bills.

**Reasons why hospitals might need ESS:**

* **Cost savings:** ESS combined with solar PV can reduce reliance on expensive grid power and diesel fuel, especially in peak hours.
* **Sustainability:** Integrating solar PV with ESS allows hospitals to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to environmental goals.
* **Microgrid potential:** Rural hospitals or off-grid facilities can benefit from ESS and solar for independent power generation, improving healthcare access in remote areas.
* **Enhanced resilience:** During natural disasters or emergencies, ESS can provide crucial backup power, ensuring continued operation of critical medical services.

However, there are also **factors to consider:**

* **Initial investment:** Although cost-effective in the long run, ESS can have higher upfront costs than traditional backup generators.
* **Space constraints:** Installing sufficient battery capacity might require dedicated space within the hospital.
* **Maintenance:** Proper maintenance is crucial for optimal performance and lifespan of ESS.

### Microgrid Solutions

Off-grid capabilities valuable for rural healthcare facilities or during emergencies.

### Batteries for medical devices

Portable and lightweight batteries essential for mobile equipment and critical care applications.

### Maintenance and service

Ongoing service contracts offer recurring revenue and ensure system reliability.
