## Vitepress配置Github Pages

Github workflow配置如下：

``` yml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a VitePress site to GitHub Pages
#
name: Deploy VitePress site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the `main` branch. Change this to `master` if you're
  # using the `master` branch as the default branch.
  push:
    branches: [main]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Not needed if lastUpdated is not enabled
      # - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2 # Uncomment this if you're using pnpm
      # - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1 # Uncomment this if you're using Bun
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: npm # or pnpm / yarn
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install # or pnpm install / yarn install / bun install / npm ci
      - name: Build with VitePress
        run: yarn docs:build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: .vitepress/dist

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

注意`config.mts`的`base`也要配置为项目名称，格式为`/project_name/`。
