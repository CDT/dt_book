# Quasar

- A Vue.js-based framework for building high-performance, responsive websites, mobile apps, and desktop apps with a unified codebase, offering Material Design components, powerful CLI tools, cross-platform capabilities, and excellent performance optimization features.

## Installation

1. Create a quasar project using template: 

``` bash
yarn create quasar
```

- (Optional) For doing more with Quasar, you should also install the global CLI. With it you can directly run Quasar commands in the terminal, run a local http server for testing or do upgrades on your project.

``` bash
yarn global add @quasar/cli
```

2. Start the dev server

``` bash
cd [project_folder_name]

# if you have the global CLI:
quasar dev
# otherwise:
yarn quasar dev
# or: 
npx quasar dev
```
